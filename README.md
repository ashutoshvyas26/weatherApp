## 🔑 API Key Notice
This project uses the **OpenWeather API** for fetching weather data. 

⚠️ **For demo purposes, the API key is currently included in the source code (`script.js`).** 

In a production environment, this should be handled via:
- Environment variables
- Backend proxy server
- Serverless functions

**To use this project:**
1. Get your free API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Replace the `apiKey` variable in `script.js` with your key
3. Monitor your API usage to stay within the free tier limits (1,000 calls/day)
